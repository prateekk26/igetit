      <p className="lede">I Get It is run by {CONTACT.name}, an individual in India. Using it means you agree to these terms. They're short on purpose.</p>
      <h2>What I Get It is</h2>
      <p>You type something you want to learn. AI models write a handbook of up to seven chapters for you, one chapter at a time: Google's Gemini looks the topic up and writes the plan and the chapters, and Anthropic's Claude checks each chapter for mistakes before you see it (and writes it if Gemini fails).</p>
      <p>It's a study aid. The checks catch a lot, not everything. On money, health and legal topics, treat it as a starting point and check before you act. Nothing here is professional advice.</p>
      <h2>Your account</h2>
      <p>You can read without signing in; your progress is kept on your phone. Sign in to keep it across devices and to pay. Most accounts sign in with a code by email; if you chose a password, keep it to yourself, and a code by email signs you in if you forget it. You're responsible for what happens under your account.</p>
      <h2>Fair use</h2>
      <p>Don't use I Get It to learn to hurt, threaten, deceive or stalk people, break into accounts or devices, or make weapons or drugs. It will decline those topics or offer a better version. Don't try to overload or break the service, or scrape it.</p>
      <h2>What you get, and what it costs</h2>
      <p>Without an account: chapters 1 and 2 of any handbook, and one handbook you type, up to 3 new chapters a day. With a free account: every chapter of every ready and shared handbook and of your one typed handbook, up to 3 new chapters a day; 3 web-checked answers a week. Members: 3 typed handbooks on the go at a time (up to 6 new a month), up to 7 new chapters a day across all their handbooks, as many ready and shared handbooks as they like, 30 web-checked answers a month, printing or saving any of their handbooks as a PDF, and first access to new parts when they launch. Chapters you've already opened stay open. A one-sitting handbook (a recipe, a short recap) never counts toward the chapters a day. When free readers' use costs too much in one day, new typed topics and web-checked answers pause for free readers until the next day; members are not paused.</p>
      <p>The member price depends on when you first pay: the first 50 paying readers pay ₹199 a month or ₹1,999 a year, the next 100 pay ₹299 or ₹2,999, the next 200 pay ₹399 or ₹3,999, and everyone after that pays ₹499 or ₹4,999. You keep the price you first paid as long as you pay again within 7 days of your time running out. The Pricing screen shows the tiers and how many spots are left.</p>
      <p>Each payment is one-time: a month covers 30 days and a year covers 365 days. Nothing renews by itself: you're only charged when you tap Pay and approve it in Razorpay's payment sheet. Prices include any taxes that apply.</p>
      <p>If we change what members get, this page will say so first, and anything you already paid for stays as it was until your time runs out.</p>
      <h2>Handbooks you make</h2>
      <p>The handbooks are written by the model for you. We may share a handbook in the public library so others can read it too. It's shared only after an automatic check that it holds nothing personal, and it never carries your name or email. If you want one taken down, write to <Email />.</p>
      <h2>Changes and limits</h2>
      <p>We may change or stop features. Payments are final, except when a payment goes wrong: see <a href="/refunds">Refunds</a>. The service is offered as it is; to the extent the law allows, our total responsibility to you is what you paid in the last 30 days. Indian law applies.</p>

      <p className="lede">What we keep, why, who else sees it, and how to have it deleted. No ads, no data sold, no outside analytics.</p>
      <h2>What we keep</h2>
      <ul className="policy-list">
        <li><strong>What you type:</strong> your topic (up to 200 characters), level, reading voice, the one-line profile you set, questions you ask on a card, and what you write in "teach it back".</li>
        <li><strong>How you read:</strong> your answers, progress, chapter ratings, and simple events (which screen and card you reached, phone or computer, screen width, the link you came from).</li>
        <li><strong>A device code:</strong> a random code stored on your phone so your progress works before you sign in. No cookies from anyone else.</li>
        <li><strong>If you sign in:</strong> your email, and a scrambled form of your password if you chose one (we never see the password itself). Sign-in codes are emailed from our Gmail account (Google). We only ever email you those codes, and reminders if you turn them on. No spam, ever.</li>
        <li><strong>If you turn on reminders:</strong> the push address your browser gives us and the time you chose.</li>
        <li><strong>If you pay:</strong> the amount, the date and Razorpay's order and payment numbers. Your card, UPI or bank details go to Razorpay only; we never see them.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Who else sees it</h2>
      <ul className="policy-list">
        <li><strong>Convex</strong> (United States) stores everything above and hosts the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> (United States) receives your topic, level, profile line and questions so Claude can write and check your chapters. Anthropic doesn't train its models on this data. Some questions are answered with a web search run through Anthropic; the search sees the question, not who asked it.</li>
        <li><strong>Google</strong> (United States) receives the words of a topic you type, the level you picked, the goal you chose for it and, since 8 October, the plan and chapter text as it is written: Google's Gemini model researches the topic with Google Search and writes the plan and the chapters (Anthropic's Claude writes them if Gemini fails, and checks every chapter). It gets nothing else about you. Google may keep and use these words under its API terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Langfuse</strong> (United States) receives the numbers behind each AI call we make for a handbook: which step, which model, how long it took, how many tokens, whether it failed. Never the words you typed, never the chapter text, never anything about you. We use it to see where the writing is slow or failing.</li>
        <li><strong>Razorpay</strong> (India) handles payments and sees what you enter in its payment sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Research before writing:</strong> when you type a topic, Google's Gemini looks it up with Google Search. If Google is busy, the same words go to Anthropic for a web search instead. The topic's words (never anything about you) are also used to look it up on Wikipedia and, for films, series, books and games, to fetch the transcript of a public YouTube recap through <strong>Supadata</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Runway</strong> may draw a handbook's cover from its first chapter's text. Other pictures are photos from Wikimedia Commons. Neither gets anything about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> serves the typefaces, so your browser contacts Google when the page loads.</li>
        <li><strong>Your browser's push service</strong> (Google, Apple or Mozilla) delivers reminders, if you turned them on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Handbooks can be shared in the public library after an automatic check that they hold nothing personal. Shared copies never carry your name or email.</p>
      <h2>How long, and your choices</h2>
      <p>We keep your data while you use I Get It. Ask for a copy, a correction or deletion at <Email />, and we'll do it within 30 days. Deleting removes your handbooks, progress and sign-in. We keep payment records as long as Indian tax law requires.</p>
      <p>If you're under 18, use I Get It with a parent's or guardian's permission.</p>
      <p>Questions or complaints about your data go to {CONTACT.name} at <Email />.</p>

  refunds: (
    <>
      <p className="lede">Chapters 1 and 2 of any handbook are free without an account, and a free account opens the rest of every ready handbook plus your one typed handbook, so you can see exactly what you're paying for before you pay.</p>
      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>Payments are final: we don't give refunds, for a month or a year. That's why your first handbook is free and nothing renews by itself, so you only ever pay for time you chose.</p>
      <p>The one exception is a payment that went wrong; see below.</p>
      <h2>Cancelling</h2>
      <p>There's nothing to cancel: nothing renews by itself. If you don't pay again, you aren't charged. Your handbooks and progress stay yours either way.</p>
      <h2>Delivery</h2>
      <p>I Get It is a digital service. Nothing is shipped. Your paid month or year starts the moment Razorpay confirms the payment, and the Pricing screen shows the date it runs until.</p>
      <h2>If a payment goes wrong</h2>
      <p>If you were charged twice, or you paid and your plan didn't start, write to <Email /> with the Razorpay payment number from your receipt, and we'll sort it out. We reply within 2 working days.</p>
      <p>If you were charged but the app doesn't show it yet, wait 10 minutes first: Razorpay sometimes confirms late.</p>
